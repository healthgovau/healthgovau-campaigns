            <h2>Why we're expanding</h2>
            <p>The risk of breast cancer increases with age. That’s why the age group of women invited for free breast screening has now changed from 50-69 to 50-74.</p>
            <p>We’d like more women to participate and continue participating in our program. Quite simply, encouraging more women to participate will detect more breast cancers and save more lives.</p>
