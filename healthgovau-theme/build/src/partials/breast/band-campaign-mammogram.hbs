            <h2>Early detection is better because:</h2>
            <p>A BreastScreen Australia representative will collect your forms and explain what will happen.
            <p> A female radiographer will take you to the X-ray room.</p>
            <p> You will be asked to remove your top in private.</p>
            <p> When you are ready the radiographer will take at least two X-rays of each breast.</p>
            <p>The X-ray machine will firmly press each breast to get the best X-ray. The pressing may be uncomfortable
                but any discomfort usually only lasts around 10 seconds. </p>
