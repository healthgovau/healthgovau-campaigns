            <h2>Breast Cancer in Australia</h2>
            <p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Australian women. One in eight women will be diagnosed with
                breast cancer in their lifetime.</p><p>However, it’s encouraging to know that thanks to better services and
                greater knowledge and awareness, fewer women are losing their lives to breast cancer.</p>
