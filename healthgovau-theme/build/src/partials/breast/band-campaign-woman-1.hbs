            <p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Australian women. One in eight women will be diagnosed with
                breast cancer in their lifetime.</p><p>However, itâ€™s encouraging to know that thanks to better services and
                greater knowledge and awareness, fewer women are losing their lives to breast cancer.</p>
