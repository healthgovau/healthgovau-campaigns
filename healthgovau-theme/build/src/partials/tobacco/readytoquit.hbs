<h2>Cold turkey</h2>
<p>'Cold Turkey' is giving up smoking suddenly, without the help of quitting products. This is how most people quit smoking.</p>

<h2>Nicotine replacement products</h2><p>Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) works by reducing withdrawal symptoms such as cravings, irritability, mood swings and anxiety. If you use these medications properly, it is possible you can double your chances of quitting successfully. NRT products include patches, chewing gum, tablets and inhalers.</p><p>Nicotine patches (several brands and strengths) are available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for all eligible Australians (including concession card holders). All these products are available at a reduced price for eligible patients through the PBS with a prescription from a General Practitioner (GP) or health professional. Consult with your GP or health professional about which products might suit you.</p>

<h2>Prescription medications</h2><p>Both Bupropion (Zyban) and Varenicline (Champix®) reduce withdrawal symptoms when you quit. Varenicline also works by blocking the nicotine receptors in your brain and making smoking less satisfying. These medications are not suitable for everyone and you should talk to your General Practitioner or health professional to find out if they're right for you.</p><p>The Government subsidises the cost of these medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). You are allowed two courses of Bupropion and up to three courses of Varenicline on the PBS per year, provided you receive coaching support from the Quitline or a health professional while you’re quitting.</p>

<h2>Quitline (13 7848)</h2><p>The Quitline is a telephone service available to smokers who want to quit and will help you get the most out of using quitting products. Call the Quitline to speak with an advisor to find out what kind of help is available. You can also speak with Indigenous advisors and request follow up calls.</p>

<h2>My Quitbuddy</h2><p>My QuitBuddy is a mobile phone app designed to support and encourage you on your journey to becoming smoke-free. The personalised application provides a countdown to your quit attempt, tracks your quitting progress and checks in to make sure you stay smoke free.</p>
